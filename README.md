# Setting A Dockerized Python Environment - The Elegant Way

This repo provides the code examples for this medium article. This includes the following three examples:
- [Basic settings]() - a simple example of the `devcontainers.json` settings using the `image` argument to launch a dockerized session with the `python:3.10` image
- [Build settings]() - extending the first example by using the `build` argument to build the image from a Dockerfile
- [Customization settings]() - adding to the previous example the `customizations` argument to set the default Python interpreter and define the extension settings
